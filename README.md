## OSINT&Crypto: **Odd Chessboard**


**Description:**
 My brother just told me he won his first ever chess game! he said he was still kinda confused about the piece positions they didn’t look exactly like how he learned them. At first I thought he was just messing around, until he actually showed me the chessboard!

I used to wonder how people even play a game like that, but then I saw some real matches and it all started to make sense.

Oh, and btw I have a feeling my brother might’ve cheated a little in his game not totally sure tho, his clock increased by 15 seconds after each move, prove me wrong
